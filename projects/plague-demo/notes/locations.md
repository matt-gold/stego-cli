# Locations

## LOC-COLLEGE

- Name: College chamber near the Rue Saint-Jacques
- Type: Study and disputation room
- Reference: [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris), [Rue Saint-Jacques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_Saint-Jacques_(Paris))
- Description: Stone-walled, poorly lit, dominated by a long table covered in manuscripts; the room where [Matthaeus](characters.md#CHAR-MATTHAEUS) and [Etienne](characters.md#CHAR-ETIENNE) compile the memorandum
- Significance: The space where the system is built; physically separated from the wards and streets where the plague actually operates

## LOC-HOTELDIEU

- Name: Hôtel-Dieu
- Type: Hospital ward near Notre-Dame
- Reference: [Hôtel-Dieu de Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel-Dieu_de_Paris)
- Description: Crowded, loud, smelling of vinegar and linen; priests read offices while surgeons open buboes; [Agnes](characters.md#CHAR-AGNES) manages the supply lines
- Significance: Where data is collected; the distance between this room and the college chamber is the distance between observation and explanation

## LOC-QUAY

- Name: Grain quay on the Seine
- Type: River unloading zone
- Reference: [Port de la Grève](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_Gr%C3%A8ve) (medieval commercial riverfront)
- Description: Torn sackcloth, heavy foot traffic, commercial contact between upstream suppliers and the city's markets
- Significance: [Agnes's observations](sources.md#SRC-WARD-DATA) trace infection along this route; it is the strongest evidence for material transmission and the hardest for the [celestial framework](sources.md#SRC-CONJUNCTION) to accommodate

## LOC-CHARNEL

- Name: Charnel precinct at the cemetery edge
- Type: Overflow burial ground
- Reference: [Holy Innocents' Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Innocents%27_Cemetery)
- Description: Where the dead go when the dead outnumber the rites; compressed ritual, civic exhaustion
- Significance: The place that makes the need for an explanation urgent — not because understanding will stop the dying, but because the alternative is dying without a frame
