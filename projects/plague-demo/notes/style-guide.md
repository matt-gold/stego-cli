# Style Guide

- Keep period belief systems sincere; Matthaeus is not wrong by the standards of his world, which is the point.
- Prose should be precise, declarative, and conceptually rigorous; resist ornamentation except in moments of sensory grounding.
- Let the central question — whether total coherence is the same as understanding — arrive through concrete scenes, never through exposition.
- Agnes and Matthaeus disagree genuinely; neither is a straw figure for the other's position.
- Use the two-ledger motif (accepted causes, unreconciled observations) as a structural anchor: the second ledger empties over the course of the story.
