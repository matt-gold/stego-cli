## SRC-CONJUNCTION

- Name: The Great Conjunction theory
- Tradition: University astrology ([Paris faculty opinion of 1348](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#Medical_knowledge))
- Reference: [Great Conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction)
- Claim: The conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in Aquarius corrupted the atmosphere universally; local outbreaks are secondary effects of a celestial primary cause
- Used by: [Matthaeus](characters.md#CHAR-MATTHAEUS) as the apex of his causal hierarchy; [Raoul](characters.md#CHAR-RAOUL) as the politically safest framing
- Limitation: Explains everything at once, which means it predicts nothing in particular

## SRC-GALEN

- Name: Galenic humoral medicine
- Tradition: Greco-Arabic medical inheritance
- Reference: [Humorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism), [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen)
- Claim: Individual susceptibility depends on bodily complexion (balance of humors); treatment involves restoring balance through diet, purgation, and environment
- Used by: [Matthaeus](characters.md#CHAR-MATTHAEUS) as the middle layer of his framework — celestial disposition selects who is vulnerable, humoral constitution determines who actually sickens
- Limitation: Cannot explain why entire neighborhoods fall at once regardless of individual constitution

## SRC-PICATRIX

- Name: The Picatrix tradition (astral image-magic)
- Tradition: Arabic-Latin occult philosophy; illicit but circulated among scholars
- Reference: [Picatrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picatrix)
- Claim: Correspondences between celestial configurations and material effects can be exploited through elected images and talismans
- Used by: [Matthaeus](characters.md#CHAR-MATTHAEUS) privately, not for its conclusions but for its method — reasoning from correspondences when direct causes are hidden
- Limitation: Institutionally dangerous; its intellectual lineage is foreign, secretive, and insufficiently baptized

## SRC-WARD-DATA

- Name: Agnes's ward observations
- Tradition: None; empirical record-keeping without institutional backing
- Reference: [Miasma theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory) (the contemporary framework Agnes's data implicitly challenges)
- Claim: Infection follows grain traffic and commercial contact; neighborhoods tied to the [quay](locations.md#LOC-QUAY) sicken first, then adjacent streets, then the rest
- Used by: [Agnes](characters.md#CHAR-AGNES) as practical knowledge; [Matthaeus](characters.md#CHAR-MATTHAEUS) acknowledges the pattern but classifies it as a secondary distributing cause, subordinate to celestial disposition
- Limitation: No theoretical framework to explain why the pattern holds; accurate but institutionally weightless
