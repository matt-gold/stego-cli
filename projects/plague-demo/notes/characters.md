## CHAR-MATTHAEUS

- Name: Magister Matthaeus de Rota
- Role: Scholar of medicine and astrology at the University of Paris
- Disposition: Methodical, sincere, incapable of leaving an observation outside his system; treats coherence as a moral obligation
- Sources: Works primarily from the [conjunction theory](sources.md#SRC-CONJUNCTION) and [Galenic tradition](sources.md#SRC-GALEN); consults the [Picatrix](sources.md#SRC-PICATRIX) privately for its method of reasoning from hidden correspondences
- Arc: Builds a total explanation of the pestilence and dies at peace inside it; the question is whether his peace is understanding or its most sophisticated substitute

## CHAR-ETIENNE

- Name: Etienne of Saint-Marcel
- Role: Young cleric-scribe attached to [Matthaeus](characters.md#CHAR-MATTHAEUS)
- Disposition: Careful, loyal, doctrinally cautious; sees everything his master does and says nothing about the parts that trouble him
- Function: The story's witness; records the system without fully believing it, but also without offering an alternative

## CHAR-AGNES

- Name: Agnes the apothecary
- Role: Compounder and practical healer near the Petit Pont; supplies [Hôtel-Dieu](locations.md#LOC-HOTELDIEU)
- Disposition: Empirical, blunt, uninterested in frameworks that don't predict which street sickens next
- Sources: Her own [ward observations](sources.md#SRC-WARD-DATA); she has no name for her method, which is part of its strength and its institutional weakness
- Function: The counterweight; asks whether a system that can absorb any evidence without changing is a system or a habit

## CHAR-RAOUL

- Name: Canon Raoul de Villiers
- Role: Cathedral canon and royal intermediary overseeing the inquiry
- Disposition: Pragmatic, literate, concerned with language fit for governance; judges arguments by their civic effects, not their truth
- Relationship: Commissioned [Matthaeus](characters.md#CHAR-MATTHAEUS) and will approve or suppress his conclusions; represents the institution's need for a single authorized account
