The faculty hearing began as a technical disputation and ended as an inquiry into method. Three masters objected to Matthaeus from different directions: one said he conceded too much to natural causes, another said he conceded too much to celestial judgment, a third said he imported suspect languages from Arabic traditions into Christian medicine. The objections were mutually exclusive, which should have cancelled them out but instead compounded them, because the real charge was not error but imprudence.

Raoul asked to see all sources. John presented the conjunction tables and the Galenic commentaries openly. He withheld the quire until asked a second time. When he produced it, the room changed temperature.

No one accused him of sorcery. They accused him of carelessness: in a season of mass death, even method could scandalize if its lineage looked foreign or secretive or insufficiently authorized. The problem was not what the quire said. The problem was that Matthaeus had kept it at all — that he had judged for himself which sources were useful and which were not, without waiting to be told.

He defended himself precisely. A text could be illicit in circulation yet sound in analysis; truth did not inherit legal status from its scribes. Raoul answered that governance could not afford that distinction under plague conditions.

The compromise was severe but survivable. Matthaeus would keep his position, surrender the quire, and circulate only conclusions framed in authorized language. Etienne copied the agreement and watched his master sign it without hesitation, as though the quire had already given him everything he needed and its confiscation changed nothing.
