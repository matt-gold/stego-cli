The hearing began as a technical disputation and ended as an inquiry into loyalty. Three masters objected to Matthaeus from opposite directions: one said he granted too much to natural causes, another said he granted too much to judgment, a third said he imported suspect languages from Arabic books into Christian medicine.

Raoul asked to see all sources. Matthaeus presented the almanac openly and withheld the loose quire until asked a second time. When he finally produced it, the room changed. No one accused him of sorcery. They accused him of imprudence: in a season of terror, even method could scandalize if its lineage looked foreign, secretive, or insufficiently baptized.

Matthaeus defended himself with calm precision. He said a text could be illicit in circulation yet useful in analysis; truth did not inherit legal status from scribes. Raoul answered that governance could not distinguish so finely under plague conditions.

The compromise was severe but survivable. Matthaeus would keep his position, surrender the quire for review, and circulate only conclusions framed in authorized language. Etienne copied the agreement and watched his master sign without hesitation, as if sacrificing one instrument for the sake of preserving the larger inquiry.
