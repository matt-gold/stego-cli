At Hôtel-Dieu, prayer and treatment proceeded in one rhythm. Priests read offices while surgeons opened buboes. Women washed linen in vinegar while clerks recited names for the burial lists. Nobody in that room believed they were choosing between faith and medicine. The distinction did not apply.

Matthaeus and Etienne recorded onset dates, households, trades, parish boundaries. They worked quickly because the data changed every hour. Agnes met them at the supply entrance and walked them through her own records — a set of tallies she had kept since August, organized not by humoral type or celestial sign but by street and supplier.

Her map was simple. Neighborhoods tied to the grain quay sickened first. Adjacent streets followed within days. The rest of the city came after. The pattern was consistent across three months of data.

At the quay she showed them torn sackcloth from a riverside storehouse and asked what his conjunction tables would have predicted for this street, this month. Matthaeus answered in the terms his system provided: commerce might distribute the material substrate, but the disposition of bodies to receive corruption remained celestial. Agnes said that might be true and still leave the wrong people dead first.

He wrote her observation in the second ledger. He expected to reconcile it later. The framework had room. It had been designed to have room.
