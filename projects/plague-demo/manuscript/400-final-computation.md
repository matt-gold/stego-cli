Fever found Matthaeus before the final memorandum left the college. He continued dictation between coughing fits, demanding that Etienne recompute the conjunction tables aloud until each figure matched his own working.

His decisive claim came on the second night: the plague's deepest cause was not any single market pathway but a Saturnine disposition spread through autumn air, selecting bodies already prepared by complexion and season. Local contacts remained real, but secondary. The argument satisfied every level of his intellectual world at once. For the first time in weeks, he slept without struggle.

Agnes visited once and found him lucid, almost serene. He thanked her for observations from the wards and told her she had supplied indispensable particulars. Then he placed those particulars within his final hierarchy and seemed relieved to see nothing left outside it.

Raoul approved the text with minor revisions and ordered copies for parish use. By dawn, bells from Hotel-Dieu had begun the office for the dying. Matthaeus held his lead seal and Etienne's hand, then said, with unmistakable peace, that the world had become intelligible again.

He died before terce. The manuscript traveled farther than his body did.
