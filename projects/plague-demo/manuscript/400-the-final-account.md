The fever found Matthaeus before the memorandum was finished. He continued dictation from bed, his voice steady and his argument tightening as his body failed. Etienne checked each figure against the conjunction tables. Everything held.

The final account worked like this: celestial disposition was the universal cause. Humoral constitution was the selecting cause. Local conditions — trade, proximity, season — were distributing causes. Agnes's ward data occupied the third level cleanly. The grain routes were real. Their explanatory weight was tertiary. Nothing was denied. Everything was ranked.

Agnes visited once. He was lucid, almost calm. He thanked her for indispensable observations. Then he placed those observations inside a hierarchy that made them subordinate to forces she could not see and he could not test, and he seemed relieved to find that nothing was left outside the system.

She asked which street he expected to sicken next. He said that was not the kind of question the memorandum addressed. She said she knew. The families at Hôtel-Dieu also knew.

Raoul approved the text. By dawn the bells had begun the office for the dying. Matthaeus held Etienne's hand and said, with what sounded like genuine peace, that the account was complete and that nothing had been left out.

He died before terce. The second ledger was empty. Every observation had been reconciled. The manuscript traveled farther than his body did.
