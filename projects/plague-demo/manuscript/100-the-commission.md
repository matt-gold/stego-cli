Canon Raoul arrived before vespers with sealed instructions from men who did not sign their names. The commission was simple in expression and impossible in execution: produce an account of the pestilence that would sustain public discipline, satisfy the faculty, and be true. Raoul did not rank these requirements. Matthaeus understood that the ranking was the actual task.

He accepted because refusal was not among the options and because explanation, as such, was a duty he believed in. He told Etienne to prepare two ledgers: one for accepted causes, one for observations not yet reconciled. He expected the second ledger to empty into the first as the work progressed. That was what reconciliation meant — not that everything would be easy, but that everything would eventually belong somewhere.

His framework was a hierarchy. At the top, celestial disposition: the conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars corrupting the air universally. Below that, the Galenic layer: individual complexion determining who sickened and who did not. Below that, local conditions — climate, trade, proximity. Every level consistent with the one above it. Every observation assigned a position.

When Raoul left, Matthaeus unlocked a coffer beneath the desk and withdrew a loose quire copied from a prohibited tradition of astral image-magic. He consulted it only in private, not for its conclusions but for its method: how to reason from correspondences when causes were hidden. Etienne saw the motion and looked away. Between them, this silence had long been a professional courtesy.
