I'd be happy to help with alternatives for that opening passage. Here are a few options:

**Option 1 (Formal/Historical):**
Canon Raoul arrived before vespers bearing sealed instructions from men who did not sign their names. The mandate was simple in expression and impossible in execution: produce an account of the pestilence that could sustain discipline, preserve orthodoxy, and satisfy the faculty.

**Option 2 (More direct):**
Canon Raoul arrived before vespers with sealed instructions from unnamed men. His commission was deceptively simple: produce an account of the pestilence that could sustain discipline, preserve orthodoxy, and satisfy the faculty.

**Option 3 (Tighter/More narrative):**
Before vespers, Canon Raoul arrived with sealed instructions from men who did not sign their names—a commission both simple and impossible: account for the pestilence while preserving discipline, orthodoxy, and the faculty's confidence.

Each maintains your manuscript's formal tone while varying emphasis. Which direction appeals to you?


Matthaeus accepted because refusal was impossible and because explanation, in itself, was a duty. He set his astrolabe beside the almanac and asked Etienne to prepare two ledgers: one for accepted causes, one for observations not yet reconciled. He believed reconciliation was always possible if one respected hierarchy: Providence, stars, elements, humors, symptoms.

When Raoul asked whether the conjunction alone could bear the whole argument, Matthaeus answered that celestial influence was primary but not solitary. A universal disposition still required local instruments. The canon said instruments were admissible so long as they did not multiply panic.

After the canon left, Matthaeus unlocked a coffer beneath the desk and withdrew a loose quire copied from a prohibited tradition of astral image-magic. He consulted it only in private, not for doctrine but for method: how to reason from correspondences when causes were hidden. Etienne saw the motion and looked away. Between them, this silence had long been a professional courtesy.
