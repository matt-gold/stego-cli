At Hotel-Dieu, prayer and treatment proceeded in one rhythm. Priests read offices while surgeons opened buboes; women washed linen in vinegar while clerks recited names for burial lists. No one believed they were choosing between faith and medicine.

Matthaeus and Etienne recorded onset dates, households, trades, and parish boundaries. Agnes corrected families when panic collapsed sequence into noise. Her practical map of the city suggested that neighborhoods tied to grain traffic sickened early, then adjacent streets, then the rest.

At the quay she showed them torn sackcloth from a riverside storehouse and asked whether this belonged inside learned causation or outside it. Matthaeus answered in formal terms: commerce might distribute effects, but disposition of bodies remained celestial. Agnes said that might be true and still leave the wrong men dead first.

That night Matthaeus compared the ward ledger with a page from his forbidden quire on elected images against putrid airs. He trusted neither source alone. He trusted only the work of forcing unlike authorities into a single system.
