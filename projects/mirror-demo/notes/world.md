## The Mirror

Decision-reconstruction system built by Clarent Applied Cognition. Takes any documented decision and produces a complete causal account — not a guess, but a provably accurate reconstruction from behavioral, contextual, and sensor data. Outputs are causal graphs rendered into prose.

The system maps causes, not reasons. It tracks what actually influenced a decision, which may differ from what the decision-maker would sincerely say influenced them.

## Clarent Applied Cognition

Mid-size research firm in Boston's Seaport district. Sells decision-reconstruction to hospitals, courts, and parole boards. The verification team audits every reconstruction before delivery to clients.

## Verification / fidelity auditing

An auditor's job is to confirm that a reconstruction is faithful to the source data — that the causal graph is justified. The open question is whether "faithful to the data" and "faithful to the decision" are the same thing.
