# Style Guide

- Keep the speculative premise narrow and take it seriously; the Mirror is not magic, it is engineering.
- Let philosophical questions arrive through concrete professional situations, never through exposition.
- Characters reason aloud in dialogue but never lecture; disagreements are real, not pedagogical.
- Maintain precise, declarative sentences; resist lyricism except in moments of private thought.
