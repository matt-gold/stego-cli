The Mirror's account of Vera's decision to join Clarent was, like all its outputs, a causal graph rendered into prose. It read like a biography written by someone who had access to everything except the experience of being you.

The top-weighted factor was not the salary or the research opportunity. It was the structure of the verification role itself — the guarantee that her job would consist of determining whether accounts of human decisions were accurate. The Mirror traced this preference to a cluster of earlier events: her mother's stroke when Vera was twenty-six, the conflicting explanations from three neurologists, the year she spent afterward unable to trust any professional judgment, including her own.

It was not wrong. She could see, with the particular nausea of recognition, that the causal chain was sound. Her doctoral work on formal semantics of intent — the Mirror connected that too, neatly, to the same origin. The desire to build a system for knowing why people do things: it came from the experience of standing in a hospital hallway and not knowing why three qualified doctors could look at the same scan and reach three different conclusions.

She sat on her bed and reread the chain. Each link was defensible. The whole sequence was defensible. What she couldn't determine was whether it was reductive or merely accurate.
