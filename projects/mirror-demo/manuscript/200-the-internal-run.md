The internal runs were David's idea, or at least David was the one who proposed them in the meeting. Soo-Jin approved with a condition: only volunteers, only anonymized, only reviewed by the verification team. The company wanted to demonstrate that the Mirror could survive self-application — that Clarent's own decisions held up under the same scrutiny they sold to hospitals and courts.

Fourteen employees volunteered. The Mirror reconstructed their hiring decisions: why Clarent chose them, and why they chose Clarent.

David brought the results to the lab on a Thursday. He gave Vera her file without ceremony, the way you hand someone a coffee.

"You don't have to read it," he said.

"Did you read yours?"

"Twice." He sat down. "It was less interesting than I expected. Mostly salary and location. I'm a simple man."

Vera held the file for a moment before opening it. Thirty-two pages. The first section was Clarent's side — why the hiring committee selected her. That part was boring in a reassuring way: publication record, reference strength, interview scores. She was the strongest candidate by every metric they tracked.

The second section was hers. Why she accepted the offer.

She read it once at her desk. She read the last four pages again. Then she closed the file and put it in her bag and told David she was leaving early.

"Anything wrong?"

"No. Just done for the day."

She could tell he didn't believe her. She was grateful that he didn't say so.
