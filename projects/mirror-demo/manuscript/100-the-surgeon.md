The reconstruction said Dr. Aller chose to operate at 4:17 a.m. because of seven factors, weighted and sequenced across forty-one pages. Vera read all of them. She verified the sensor logs, the shift reports, the vitals timeline. She cross-referenced the Mirror's causal graph against the anesthesiologist's notes. Everything checked.

She flagged it anyway.

David pulled his chair over when she pinged him. "Which part?"

"None of it's wrong." She pointed at the second-order inference on page nineteen, where the Mirror attributed sixteen percent of the decision weight to the surgeon's awareness that the patient's daughter was a malpractice attorney. "It's accurate. It cites the intake note where nursing flagged the family. It shows his eye tracking lingered on that line. The causal weight is formally justified."

"So what's the problem?"

"The problem is that if you showed this to Dr. Aller, he would say it wasn't a factor. And he would believe it. And the Mirror would be right and he would also be right, and those two things shouldn't both be possible."

David was quiet for a while. He spun his pen in a full rotation, which was what he did instead of saying something he'd retract later. "The system wasn't built to distinguish between what influences a decision and what a person would say influenced their decision. Those are different data sets. We only track the first one."

"I know."

"So you're not flagging an error. You're flagging a design choice."

"I'm flagging the fact that we're going to hand this to a hospital and they're going to show it to a surgeon who will read that his patient's family intimidated him into operating, and he will know that isn't true, and we will know that it is."
