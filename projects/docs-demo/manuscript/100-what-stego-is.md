# What Stego Is

Stego is a Markdown-first writing system for long-form projects.

It combines source files, validation, stage gates, and export in one project structure so teams can move from draft to release without switching tools.

## Core model

A Stego project has four working areas:

- `manuscript/`: canonical source text
- `notes/`: planning, references, and process docs
- `story-bible/`: canonical entity definitions for fiction projects
- `dist/`: generated outputs only

## What Stego standardizes

- metadata in frontmatter (`status` required by default)
- quality checks by stage (`draft` through `final`)
- deterministic build into a single manuscript file
- export to `md`, `docx`, `pdf`, and `epub`

## Who this is for

Stego is useful for both narrative and operational writing:

- fiction writers and story teams
- technical and product documentation teams
- internal policy/process authors

This demo project is documentation-first, but the next chapter also documents fiction and Story Bible usage.
