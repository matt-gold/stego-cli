# Implementation Notes

## Goal

Show that Stego works for product docs, procedures, and internal writing systems, not only fiction.

## Demo constraints

- Do not use Story Bible identifiers in manuscript metadata.
- Keep metadata minimal so onboarding stays simple.
- Keep chapters independently readable.

## Audience

- Product and operations teams
- Technical writers
- Solo builders documenting process
